        <h1>Tips and tricks</h1>
        <h2>Thin and sheer fabrics</h2>
        <p>If you use very tin fabrics like silk, they tend to slip away when you're cutting it. Then place
            a table cloth underneath it. That way it won't slip.</p>
        <p>When you have tin or sheer fabrics it is better to slice it than to cut it. That way it won't fray as much.</p>
        <h2>Synthetics</h2>
        <p>For cutting synthetic fabrics like lining you can use pinking shears</p>
        <h2>Stretch fabrics</h2>
        <p>Use a stretch stitch so the fabric stays stretchy.</p>
        <p>Whle sewing this fabric don't pull it too much.</p>
        <h2>For all fabrics</h2>
        <p>If you have to use a seam ripper use it with the little bal down. That way it opens up the seam, and it is easier to rip the seam.</p>
        <p>Take a margin for 1 to 2 centimeters for the length of your tread. In case you need to take it out.</p>
        <p>Place an elastic over the side of you sewing machine, besides the needle. If you let your fabric run past it, you'll always sew straight.</p>
        <p>Choose the right needle by the right fabric. For every fabric is a needle.</p>
